			Dublin City is ranked as one of the hardest cities to navigate, ranked as number five.<a href="#source1" onclick="sourceLink1()"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Several efforts have been made in attempt to reduce traffic congestion within our city, although many alleviate the issue only slightly. 
			<br><br>
			“Traffic calming” areas have been introduced in several suburbs outside of the city (such as Clondalkin and Ballinteer), particularly where traffic is incredibly heavy<a href="#source2"><sup onclick="sourceLink2()">[2]</sup></a>. These often come with reduced speed limits and smaller roads in attempt to deter non-essential and heavy-goods traffic from the area.
			<br><br>
			Other cities, such as London, have an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” (ULEZ)<a href="#source3"><sup onclick="sourceLink3()">[3]</sup></a>. In such a zone, generally any petrol vehicle newer than 2005, and generally any diesel vehicle newer than 2015 must pay a congestion fee for driving in the ULEZ. Dublin could greatly benefit from this as already seen with the College Green bus corridor; whereby all vehicles except public transport, cyclists and taxis are banned from entering College Green. There is a proposal to fully pedestrianise College Green, rerouting all traffic through Nassau Street<a href="#source4"><sup onclick="sourceLink4()">[4]</sup></a>.
			<br><br>
			On the 27th of November 2025, taxi drivers were protesting the introduction of “fixed fare” charges on the Uber taxi-hailing app. Taxi drivers were driving incredibly slowly across Dublin City causing an enormous amount of further congestion on top of the already heavy rush hour<a href="#source5"><sup onclick="sourceLink5()">[5]</sup></a>. All of the extra traffic and engine idling added to the already-high carbon emissions Dublin already has.

			In 2021, low-emission hybrid vehicles from Alexander Dennis were introduced to the Dublin Bus fleet. These began to replace the older Euro 4 emission standard vehicles from 2006-2008, creating a breath of fresh air for Dublin<a href="#source6"><sup onclick="sourceLink6()">[6]</sup></a>. These, in fact, were not the first low emissions vehicles to our city bus network; starting with a trial vehicle all the way back in 2008, a demonstrator vehicle in 2014 and 9 permanent vehicles as recent as 2019.<a href="#source7"><sup onclick="sourceLink7()">[7]</sup></a>
			<br><br>
			Since January 2023, new zero-emission electric buses have been running on the TFI network. The first location was Athlone, where eleven Alexander Dennis vehicles were put into service replacing older diesel buses. Athlone has a 100% zero emission town bus service, a first for Ireland!<a href="#source8"><sup onclick="sourceLink8()">[8]</sup></a>
			<br><br>
			Since October 2023, new Wrightbus StreetDeck vehicles have been deployed in Summerhill and Phibsboro depots of Dublin Bus. These are slowly replacing the final 2006-2008 diesel vehicles, improving both the air in our capital city and reducing carbon emissions.<a href="#source9"><sup onclick="sourceLink9()">[9]</sup></a> Utilizing some of the chargers for the 2021 hybrid buses, the rollout has been incredibly smooth; improving passenger comfort, reducing noise pollution and reducing chemical pollution. With an order for up to 600 new vehicles, TFI aims for the Dublin city bus network to be 85% low- and zero-emission by 2032, and solely zero-emission by 2035.
			<br><br>
			Clean travel in Dublin is not a new concept! The Luas light-rail system has been in operation since June 2004, and is solely operated by electric Alstom trams. Carrying over 50 million passengers in 2024, it is Dublin’s cleanest form of transport so far.<a href="#source10"><sup onclick="sourceLink10()">[10]</sup></a>
