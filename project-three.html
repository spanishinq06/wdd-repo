			Dublin City is regarded as one of the most congested cities on the planet, ranked 5th in an official survey.
			“Traffic calming” areas have been introduced in several suburbs outside of the city (such as Clondalkin and Ballinteer), particularly where traffic is incredibly heavy. These often come with reduced speed limits and smaller roads in attempt to deter non-essential traffic from the area.
			<br><br>
			Other cities, such as London, have an “Ultra Low Emissions Zone” (ULEZ). In such a zone, generally any petrol vehicle newer than 2005, and generally any diesel vehicle newer than 2015 must pay a congestion fee for driving in the ULEZ. Dublin could greatly benefit from this as already seen with the College Green bus corridor; whereby all vehicles except public transport, cyclists and taxis are banned from entering College Green.
			<br><br>
			On the 27th of November 2025, taxi drivers were protesting the introduction of “fixed fare” charges on the Uber taxi-hailing app. Taxi drivers were driving incredibly slowly across Dublin City causing an enormous amount of further congestion on top of the already heavy rush hour.

			In 2021, low-emission hybrid vehicles from Alexander Dennis were introduced to the Dublin Bus fleet. These began to replace the older Euro 4 emission standard vehicles from 2006-2008, creating a breath of fresh air for Dublin. These, in fact, were not the first low emissions vehicles to our city bus network; starting with a trial vehicle all the way back in 2008, a demonstrator vehicle in 2014 and 9 permanent vehicles as recent as 2019.
			<br><br>
			Since 2022, new zero-emission electric buses have been running on the TFI network. The first location was Athlone, where eleven Alexander Dennis vehicles were put into service replacing older diesel buses. Athlone has a 100% zero emission town bus service, a first for Ireland!
			<br><br>
			Since 2023, new Wrightbus StreetDeck vehicles have been deployed in Summerhill and Phibsboro depots of Dublin Bus. These are slowly replacing the final 2006-2008 diesel vehicles, improving both the air in our capital city and reducing carbon emissions. Although there were some issues with the chargers in the first two years of service, the rollout has been incredibly smooth; improving passenger comfort, reducing noise pollution and reducing chemical pollution. With an order for up to 600 new vehicles, TFI aims for the Dublin city bus network to be 85% low- and zero-emission by 2032, and solely zero-emission by 2035.
			<br><br>
			Clean travel in Dublin is not a new concept! The Luas light-rail system has been in operation since June 2004, and is solely operated by electric Alstom trams. Taking an approximated 1 million cars off the road each year, it is Dublin’s cleanest form of transport so far.
